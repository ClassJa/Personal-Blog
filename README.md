# Personal-Blog

## Description 
This project utilizes the programming languages of Javascript to add logic to a webpage crafted using HTML and styled using CSS. This webpage actively updates to reflect changes made within a website's landing page and allows users to input their credentials: username, title, and content to compose a blog post. After collecting the necessary information from the user, it displays the inputted values in a stacked layout with each blog ordered vertically on the page. The final product of this webpage allows the user to toggle a button and switch between a light and dark mode theme.
